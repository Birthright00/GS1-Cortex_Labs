## How the AI Features Work

### Search Intent Analysis
The AI analyzes search queries to understand user intent by detecting key phrases:

- **Cost-focused**: "cheap", "affordable", "budget", "price"
- **Sustainability-focused**: "sustainable", "eco", "green", "organic", "carbon"
- **Reputation-focused**: "trusted", "reliable", "quality", "best", "premium"
- **Proximity-focused**: "local", "nearby", "close", "regional"

Based on detected intent, the system adjusts ranking weights. For example:
- Sustainability query â†’ 55% sustainability weight, 20% reputation, 15% cost, 10% proximity
- Cost query â†’ 50% cost weight, 20% reputation, 15% sustainability, 15% proximity

### Smart Ranking
When "AI Best Match" sort is selected, suppliers are scored using:
```
score = (normalized_cost Ã— cost_weight) +
        (normalized_sustainability Ã— sustainability_weight) +
        (normalized_reputation Ã— reputation_weight) +
        (normalized_proximity Ã— proximity_weight)
```

All metrics are normalized to 0-1 scale for fair comparison.

### Contextual Insights
The AI generates human-readable insights about search results:
- Calculates average metrics across filtered suppliers
- Provides recommendations based on the query focus
- Highlights exceptional options with emojis and actionable advice
